Test the Application:
Use curl to send a sample POST request to the Flask app:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/predict \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"data": [[8.3252, 41, 6.984127, 1.02381, 322, 2.555556, 37.88, -122.23], [8.3014, 21, 6.238137, 1.072314, 240, 2.109842, 37.86, -122.22]]}'
This command sends a JSON payload containing sample data to the /predict endpoint of the Flask app running on port 5000. Adjust the data as needed for your use case.
